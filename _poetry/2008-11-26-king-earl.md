Who's riding so late through night and wind
Where daylight ends and the neon signs begin?
Who's riding so late through wind and night?
What if he might …

Who's hunting so long after the wind
Where just broken hearts lie within?
Who's hunting so long after the night?
Is it the death within?

Until the night will end
He ran, the King Earl

Who's fleeing so hasty through the night
When there are so many places to hide?
Who's seeing the king in the night
And now he might …

Who's hunting so long after the night?
Is it the death within?
Who's hunting so long after the wind?
It is the love within!

It is the King
The King Earl
On golden wings
He's getting closer to his girl
It is the King
The King Earl

It is the King
My King Earl
Fading in the fog
Hunting this shadow that looks like me
But there is no love
In this world I see

Es ist kein Traum, der mich führt
Denn mein Ziel bleibt unbewegt
Es ist der Schmerz, den man spürt
Wenn man sich für immer schlafen legt
