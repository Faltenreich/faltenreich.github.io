I have conceptualized, developed, published and maintained multiple projects. My main focus is the development for mobile platforms but I am also experienced in developing small backends or setting up a Backend-as-a-service.

### Android <img src="/assets/images/android.png" class="platform-icon"/> 

I have started development for Android in 2012 during my Bachelor studies by creating first proof-of-concepts. Some of them evolved into full-fledged projects and one of them is still running more ten years later. I have used the following technologies and many more:

- Kotlin, Java
- Android Architecture Components, Jetpack
- Gradle, Groovy, Library Development
- Firebase, Parse Server
- Retrofit, OkHttp
- Room, ObjectBox, OrmLite
- Jetpack Compose
- NFC, Bluetooth

### iOS <img src="/assets/images/ios.png" class="platform-icon"/>

I have started development for iOS in 2014 during my Master studies by taking courses and while working for a company which was developing an iOS client.

- Swift, Objective-C
- SwiftUI, UIKit
- Combine, RxSwift
- Firebase, Parse Server
- Core Data
- NFC, Bluetooth

### Multiplatform <img src="/assets/images/kotlin.png" class="platform-icon"/> <img src="/assets/images/flutter.png" class="platform-icon"/>

I have dived into Flutter many times, implemented small projects and helped maintaining legacy projects. While Google's framework is today's standard to implement once and deploy everywhere, my bet is on Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (and Compose Multiplatform) to revolutionize cross-platform development in the following years.

- Flutter, Dart
- Internationalization, Material Components
- Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile, Kotlin Native
- SQLDelight, Ktor, Coroutines, mockK, Compose

### Quality Assurance

I have experience in developing and maintaining projects that are able to go to the middle school and beyond without rusting undetected and crumbling to dust. Starting on the green field is as possible as refactoring foreign legacy projects with a beard longer than mine. I ensure that level of quality by using:

- MVVM
- Dependency Injection
- Unit-, Instrumentation- and UI Testing
- Continuous Integration, -Deployment and -Delivery
- Code Reviews on Pull Requests
- Clean Code
