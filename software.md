Honesty, transparency and community thinking. These three terms describe important values I try to live and work by. For this reason I publish many of my private projects publicly. For me Open Source describes the entrance into a community, for which there are no temporal and spatial barriers.

I have conceptualized, developed, maintained and sometimes published following software in my spare time. My main focus is the development for mobile platforms but I am also experienced in developing small backends or setting up a Backend-as-a-service.

I live and write by Clean Code â™¥
