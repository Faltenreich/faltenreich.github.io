I have started development for <img src="/assets/images/android.png" class="platform-icon"/> Android in 2012 and for <img src="/assets/images/ios.png" class="platform-icon"/> iOS in 2014. 

I have conceptualized, developed, published and maintained multiple projects. My main focus is the development for mobile platforms but I am also experienced in developing small backends or setting up a Backend-as-a-service.

I live and write by Clean Code â™¥
