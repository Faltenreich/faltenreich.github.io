    I have started development for Android in 2012 during my Bachelor studies by creating first proof-of-concepts. 
    Some of them evolved into full-fledged projects and one of them is still running almost ten years later. 
    I have used the following technologies and many more:
  technologies:
    - Kotlin, Java
    - Android Architecture Components, Jetpack
    - Gradle, Groovy, Library Development
    - Firebase, Parse Server
    - Retrofit, OkHttp
    - Room, ObjectBox, OrmLite
    - Jetpack Compose
    - NFC, Bluetooth

    I have started development for iOS in 2014 during my Master studies by taking courses and while working for a 
    company which was developing an iOS client.
  technologies:
    - Swift, Objective-C
    - SwiftUI, UIKit
    - Combine, RxSwift
    - Firebase, Parse Server
    - Core Data
    - NFC, Bluetooth

  color: "#B125EA"

    I have dived into Flutter many times, implemented small projects and helped maintaining legacy projects. 
    While Google's framework is today's standard to implement once and deploy everywhere, 
    my bet is on Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (and Compose Multiplatform) to revolutionize cross-platform development 
    in the following years.
  technologies:
    - Flutter, Dart
    - Internationalization, Material Components
    - Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile, Kotlin Native
    - SQLDelight, Ktor, Coroutines, mockK, Compose

    I have experience in maintaining projects until they enter middle school and evolve while neither 
    rusting undetected nor crumbling to dust. I ensure that level of quality by using:
  technologies:
    - MVVM
    - Dependency Injection
    - Unit-, Instrumentation- and UI Testing
    - Continuous Integration, -Deployment and -Delivery
    - Code Reviews on Pull Requests
    - Clean Code
