    I have started development for Android in 2012 during my Bachelor studies by creating first proof-of-concepts. 
    Some of them evolved into full-fledged projects and one of them is still running almost ten years later. 
    I have used the following technologies and many more:
  technologies:
    - Kotlin, Java
    - Jetpack Compose, XML
    - Android Architecture Components
    - Coroutines, Flows
    - Gradle, Groovy, Library Development
    - Firebase, Parse Server
    - Retrofit, OkHttp
    - Room, ObjectBox, OrmLite
    - Hilt, Koin
    - Espresso, mockK
    - NFC, Bluetooth

    Even though Flutter has established itself, my bet is on Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (and Compose Multiplatform) 
    to revolutionize cross-platform development once again in the following years. Therefore I am developing first 
    proof-of-concepts and going to use this technology for my next multiplatform project.
  technologies:
    - Kotlin Native
    - Compose Multiplatform
    - Material3
    - MObile KOtlin (Moko Resources)
    - SQLDelight
    - Ktor, Coroutines
    - Koin
    - kotlin.test

    - SwiftUI, UIKit
    - Combine, RxSwift
    - Firebase, Parse Server

    I have dived into Flutter many times, implemented small projects and helped maintaining legacy projects.
  technologies:
    - Dart

    - Resolver

- title: Quality Assurance
  description: >-
    I have experience in maintaining projects until they enter middle school and evolve while neither 
    rusting undetected nor crumbling to dust. I ensure that level of quality by using:
  technologies:
    - Model-View-ViewModel
    - Dependency Injection
    - Unit-, Instrumentation- and UI Testing
    - Continuous Integration, -Deployment and -Delivery
    - Code Reviews on Pull Requests
    - Clean Code
