Welcome to my website which is all about the one thing I love doing the most: writing. Be it source code, a blogpost or every now and then a piece of poetry.

This place serves one purpose: logging this work like a diary or portfolio. Fellow developers may take a look at the software I have written or took part in and hopefully learn something from the blogposts I have written. One may take a break from daily work or simply get some inspiration.
