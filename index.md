Welcome to my website which is all about the one thing I love doing the most: writing. Be it source code, a blogpost or every now and then a piece of poetry.

My name is Philipp Fahlteich. I am a software developer from Germany working in the field of mobile computing. I have written almost all my life, be it poetic, prosaic, analogue or digital.

This place serves one purpose: logging this work in some sort of diary or portfolio. Potential employers may evaluate my skills by taking a look at the software I have written or took part in. Potentially everyone, including myself, may read the blog posts, poems or stories I am writing in order to learn something new, take a break from daily work or simply to get some inspiration.
