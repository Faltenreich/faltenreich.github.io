Welcome to my website which is all about the one thing I love doing the most: writing. Be it source code, a blogpost or every now and then a piece of poetry.

I’m a software developer from Germany who got his Master of Science at the Rosenheim University of Applied Sciences. I work for a software service provider in the field of mobile computing where I conceptualize, develop, publish and maintain mobile apps for Android and iOS.

In my spare time, I discover new programming languages and frameworks for myself by developing and publishing smaller and larger projects on these platforms.

Feel free to browse through my projects and to contact me if you’d like to. You are welcome!
