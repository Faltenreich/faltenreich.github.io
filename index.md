Welcome to my website which is all about the one thing I love doing the most: writing. Be it source code, a blogpost or every now and then a piece of poetry.

I am a software developer from Germany, specialized in mobile computing. I have conceptualized, developed, published and maintained countless projects including apps for Android and iOS, continuous pipelines, small scripts, websites, backends or one or the other backend-as-a-service. In my spare time, I discover new programming languages and frameworks, one of them being the website you are currently on.
