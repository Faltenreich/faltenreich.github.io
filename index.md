# Writing Bits

Welcome to this place which is all about the one thing I love doing the most: writing. Be it source code, a blogpost or every now and then a piece of poetry.

### What is this place?

This website serves one purpose: logging my work and my hobbies as some sort of diary or portfolio. Potential employers may evaluate my skills by taking a look at the software I have written or took part in. Potentially everyone, including myself, may read the blog posts, poems or stories I am writing in order to learn something new, take a break from daily work or simply to get some inspiration.

### Where to go from here?

Feel free to browse through my projects and to contact me. You are welcome!
