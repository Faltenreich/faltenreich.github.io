I am specialized in mobile development: from the drawing board to the
implementation up to the publishing and maintenance. I am as comfortable with new
projects as I am with historical software. My aspiration is Clean Code.
In my spare time, I discover new technologies and develop proof of concepts that
potentially become full-fledged projects. I release these as open source and further
develop them in close contact with the community.
