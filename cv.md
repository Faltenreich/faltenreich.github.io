I am a software developer from Germany who got his Master of Science at the Rosenheim University of Applied Sciences. I work in the field of mobile computing where I conceptualize, develop, publish and maintain mobile apps for Android and iOS. In my spare time, I discover new programming languages and frameworks for myself by developing and publishing smaller and larger projects on these platforms.
