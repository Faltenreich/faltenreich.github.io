I am a software developer from Germany who got his Master of Science at the Rosenheim University of Applied Sciences. I am specialized in mobile computing and have conceptualized, developed, published and maintained multiple projects including small backends or setting up a Backend-as-a-service.

In my spare time, I discover new programming languages and frameworks for myself by developing and publishing smaller and larger projects on these platforms. One of them being the website you are currently on.
